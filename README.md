# sorobonproject

Voting Decentralized App with Stellar Soroban smart contract that integrates the freighter wallet that helps people to vote in proposals.

# Project Description

Our project aims to develop a decentralized voting application built on the Stellar Soroban platform. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, the application ensures transparency, security, and accessibility in the voting process. By utilizing Stellar Soroban, we harness its efficient consensus mechanism and smart contract capabilities to create a robust voting system.

# Vision Statement

Our vision is to revolutionize the democratic process by empowering individuals worldwide to participate in transparent, secure, and accessible elections through our decentralized voting application on Stellar Soroban. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to uphold the principles of integrity, fairness, and inclusivity, thereby fostering trust, engagement, and accountability in democratic governance. Our ultimate goal is to redefine the future of elections, ensuring that every voice is heard and every vote counts.

# Software Developement Plan
Requirement Gathering and Analysis: Gather detailed requirements for the smart contract functionality, including ticket issuance, validation, transfer, and refund processes. Define variables such as ticket details (event name, date, seat number), user information (buyer, seller), and transaction history.
Smart Contract Design and Development: Design the smart contract architecture using Solidity or another compatible language. Implement functions for issuing tickets, validating ticket ownership, transferring tickets between users, and handling refunds. Define variables to store ticket data, user balances, and transaction history on the Stellar blockchain.
Testing and Optimization: Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the smart contract functions as intended and handles various scenarios, including edge cases and potential vulnerabilities. Optimize code for efficiency and gas usage on the Stellar network.
Front-end Development: Develop a user-friendly front-end interface for interacting with the ticketing system. Design screens for browsing events, purchasing tickets, transferring tickets, and viewing transaction history. Integrate with the Stellar blockchain using SDKs or APIs to communicate with the smart contract.
Integration and User Testing: Integrate the smart contract with the front-end interface, ensuring seamless interaction between the two components. Conduct user testing to gather feedback on usability, functionality, and overall user experience. Make necessary adjustments based on user feedback.
Deployment: Deploy the smart contract and front-end interface to the Stellar blockchain and hosting platform, respectively. Configure network settings and permissions for the smart contract deployment. Launch the voting dapp to the public, promoting awareness and adoption among users.
